# SL2EncDecFile

On this project, I pretend to handle a file Encoder to crypt Database Settings on 
all the projects 

Functions:

    -- Generate a Key with a password
    -- Read a Decrypted File
    -- Encrypt and Save the file 



This project is part of the common L2System packages for automation.
