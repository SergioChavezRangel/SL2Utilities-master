# SL2Utilities

On this project, I pretend to handle all the libs commonly used  across 
all the projects.

Functions:

configdatareader:

    -- Generate a Key with a password
    -- Read a Decrypted xml File
    -- Encrypt and Save the xml file 
    -- Keep data on dictionary for any time usage

logger:

    -- create and handle log files
    -- as an alternative to the logging lib

This project is part of the common L2System packages for automation.
